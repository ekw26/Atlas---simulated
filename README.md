# Atlas---simulated
R code to simulate healthcare utilisation data, estimate diagnostic window length and run bootstrapping. 

## Functions
Code to simulate healthcare utilisation data for cases and controls, and to run bootstrapping for two different inflection point detection methods is provided in the 'Functions' folder.

Functions used for bootstrapping have been optimised for speed, and have been set up to run in parallel on a Windows machine with 8 cores. This code may need adapting to run on a different machine.

## Results
Raw results and summary statistics of the bootstrapping are provided for both methods in the 'Results' folder.
