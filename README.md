# Atlas---simulated
R code to simulate healthcare utilisation data, estimate diagnostic window length and run bootstrapping. 

Functions used for bootstrapping have been optimised for speed, and have been set up to run in parallel on a Windows machine with 8 cores. This code may need adapting to run on a different machine.
